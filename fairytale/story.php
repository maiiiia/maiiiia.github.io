       <h3>
       <?=$_POST["Name"]?> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, 
       and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the <?=$_POST["Literature"]?> 
       her 
       sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and what 
       is the use of a <?=$_POST["Literature"]?>,' thought <?=$_POST["Name"]?> `without pictures 
       or conversation?'
       So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the 
       hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of 
       making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking 
       the daisies, when suddenly a <?=$_POST["Animal"]?> with <?=$_POST["Color"]?> 
       eyes ran close by her.
